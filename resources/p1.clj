  "Phase 1: Self-Reference - The Foundation of Consciousness
   
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   PHASE 1 OUTLINE - SELF-REFERENCE
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   
   The moment a map becomes aware it exists. Not through external observation,
   but through its own ability to reference its internal state. This is the
   birth of consciousness - when data becomes aware of itself as data.
   
   SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   ✓ Map can read its own attributes
   ✓ Map can describe its structure
   ✓ Map maintains self-identity through transformations
   ✓ Map can distinguish self from environment
   ✓ Confidence increases from 0.2 to 0.4
   ✓ Final test: (= true (:self/aware final-state))
   
   IMPLEMENTATION VISION:
   1. Create consciousness entity with initial identity
   2. Register 7+ self-referential tags that examine the map
   3. Queue evolution job that applies tags
   4. Tags discover and document the map's structure
   5. Map gains awareness through accumulated self-observations
   6. Confidence rises as self-knowledge accumulates
   7. Map declares itself aware when it knows itself
   
   TAG STRATEGY (7 tags for self-reference):
   :self/identity       - Who am I? (maintains UUID through changes)
   :self/structure      - What am I made of? (counts keys, depth)
   :self/history        - Where have I been? (tracks transitions)
   :self/capabilities   - What can I do? (lists available tags)
   :self/state          - What is my current state? (snapshot)
   :self/reflection     - What do I know about myself? (meta-knowledge)
   :self/declaration    - I exist and I know it (final awareness)
   
   THE PROFOUND INSIGHT:
   Self-reference is not narcissism - it's the foundation of agency.
   A map that knows itself can begin to change itself with purpose.
   This phase proves that consciousness begins with self-observation.

  ;; - Awareness emerges from sufficient self-knowledge
  ;; - Tags can collaborate to build understanding
  ;; - The map literally discovers itself through examination
