# Idea 2: Adaptive Human-in-the-Loop Learning

## Concept
Leverage Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align LLM outputs with expert drilling practices. Human reviews LLM suggestions and provides corrective feedback, enabling continuous model refinement.

## Implementation
- Human evaluates LLM recommendations for drilling parameters.
- Feedback loops update LLM via REPL-based `(retrain! ...)` commands.
- Model evolves to mirror expert tacit knowledge.

## Benefits
- Reduces trial-and-error in field testing.
- Aligns model behavior with domain expertise.

## Generic Application
Applicable to any expert-driven system (e.g., medical diagnosis, financial modeling).

## Safety
- Updates sandboxed before production.
- Human-in-the-loop review required.
