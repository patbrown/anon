# Idea 1: Integrated Sensory Feedback Loops

## Concept
Merge real-time drilling data (torque, mud pressure, acoustic signals) with an LLM that parses anomalies. Human defines safety thresholds and validates via REPL.

## Implementation
- Sensors â†’ LLM via REPL.
- LLM outputs suggestions as code snippets or commands.
- Human confirms `(confirm-action ...)` or overrides.

## Benefits
- Faster decisions in high-stakes environments.
- Shared mental model of wellbore dynamics.

## Generic Application
Robotics, autonomous systems, finance.

## Safety
- Human overrides at all stages.
- Predefined safety limits in REPL.
