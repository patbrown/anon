# Idea 3: Symbolic Scaffolding for Shared Intent

## Concept
Create a shared ontology (e.g., bandana metaphor) to synchronize intent between human and LLM. Symbols serve as anchoring points for aligned actions.

## Implementation
- Define symbols representing domain-specific actions (e.g., "activate-bandana" triggers LLM to align with human intent).
- Both parties reference symbols during collaboration.
- REPL commands resolve ambiguities (e.g., `(resolve-symbol "activate-bandana")`).

## Benefits
- Reduces semantic ambiguity.
- Enables rapid co-creation.

## Generic Application
Applicable to collaborative tools, education platforms, team AI assistants.

## Safety
- Symbols documented in a shared ontology.
- Human oversight validates symbol definitions.
