# Idea 1: Integrated Sensory Feedback Loops

## Concept
Merge real-time drilling data (torque, mud pressure) with an LLM that parses and interprets anomalies. Human sets safety thresholds and validates via REPL.

## Implementation
- Sensors feed data to LLM
- LLM suggests actions in natural language
- Human confirms/rejects via REPL commands

## Benefits
- Faster decisions in high-stakes environments
- Shared mental model of wellbore dynamics

## Generic Application
Applicable to robotics, autonomous systems, finance.

## Safety
- Human overrides at all stages
- Predefined safety limits.
