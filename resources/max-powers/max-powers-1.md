# Idea 1: Integrated Sensory Feedback Loops

## Concept
Combine real-time drilling data (torque, mud pressure, acoustic signals) with an LLM that parses and interprets anomalies. Human operator defines thresholds.

## Implementation
- Sensors feed data â†’ LLM analyzes via natural language
- Human validates via REPL commands (e.g., `(confirm-action ...)`)
- Adjust drilling parameters in real-time

## Benefits
- Faster decisions in high-stakes environments
- Shared mental model of wellbore dynamics

## Generic Application
Applicable to robotics, autonomous vehicles, finance

## Safety
- Human overrides at all stages
- Pre-defined safety thresholds
