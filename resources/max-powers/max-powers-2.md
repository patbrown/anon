# Idea 2: Adaptive Human-in-the-Loop Learning

## Concept
Leverage Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align LLM outputs with expert drilling practices.

## Implementation
- Human provides feedback on LLM suggestions for drilling parameters (e.g., torque adjustments).
- Model updates its response patterns via REPL (`(retrain! ...)`).
- Continuous loop of human feedback and LLM adaptation.

## Benefits
- Reduces trial-and-error in field testing.
- Aligns model suggestions with expert tacit knowledge.

## Generic Application
Applicable to any domain with expert-in-the-loop (finance, medicine).

## Safety
- Sandbox testing of updates.
- Human review before deployment.
