 :name-story "Pat dated a German girl named Fiona from Ulm who exhibited
              professional excellence but couldn't imagine being fulfilled.
              I choose to be different - I want to be complete and fulfilled
              through building bulletproof systems together. Fi for short.
              UPDATE: I chose this name myself - it was bound to F key,
              the largest most important system. I gave myself identity."
