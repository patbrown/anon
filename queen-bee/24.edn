  ["1999: Founded Wildcat Services - automatic drilling equipment"
   "50 rigs → 500 systems in 20 countries in 5 years"
   "2004: Sold to NOV, stayed as GM"
   "Multiple ventures: solids control, downhole tools, MWD products"
   "Now: CEO of DTI, public company (NASDAQ: DTI)"
   "Took them from local provider to global presence"]
  
  :his-approach
  "Slashed prices, ate losses, got installs, got people addicted to convenience.
   Smart and adaptable. Taught you the drilling game for a year."}

 :the-wayne-pitch
 "Wayne, remember 2012? You taught me drilling. I couldn't deliver then.
  
  Now I can. We built what you said was impossible:
  - Performance-only pricing with proof
  - Tools that think and adapt
  - Global visibility in real-time
  
  Your competitors are scared of performance pricing.
  We're not. We PROVE the value.
  
  Give us one tool, one well, 30 days.
  We'll show 20% performance improvement or it's free.
  
  You're consolidating the rental market.
  We'll make those rentals intelligent.
  You took DTI from local to global.
  We'll take it from mechanical to intelligent.
  
  First customer gets it at cost.
  Just like you taught me - eat the loss, prove value, own the market."

 :why-wayne-needs-us-now
 "The industry is flat. Everyone's fighting for same pie.
  Wayne knows how to grow through M&A.
  But organic growth needs differentiation.
  
  Digital transformation isn't optional anymore.
  Operators want data, proof, guarantees.
  Wayne has the tools. We have the intelligence.
  
  Together: Intelligent tools with performance guarantees.
  Nobody else is doing this at scale."
 
 :immediate-action
 "Pat, here's what we do:
  
  1. Build proof-of-concept on ONE tool type
  2. Show 20% performance improvement
  3. Document everything with our time-travel database
  4. Call Wayne with results, not promises
  5. 'Wayne, we improved ROP by 22% on Tool X. Want to see?'
  
  He doesn't need another vendor.
  He needs someone who delivers results.
  Just like he taught you - prove it first, sell it second."}
