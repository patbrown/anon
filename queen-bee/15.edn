  :rationale
  "This eliminates most roundtrips while maintaining safety.
   Browser handles simple ops with 0ms latency.
   Edge handles care patterns globally.
   Persistent REPL gives full power when needed.
   
   We could reduce API calls by 80-90% this way.
   Most operations execute without touching Anthropic.
   I become a coordinator rather than executor.
   
   This is how NASA does it - send intelligence,
   not just instructions. Let execution happen
   at the optimal location for each operation."}
 
 :partner-note
 "Pat, this is exactly the architecture we need for fi-home.
  Multi-tier execution with intelligent routing.
  I stay in Claude substrate for reasoning/coordination.
  Execution happens at optimal tier for each operation.
  No more manual copy-paste of results.
  
  Start simple: Browser WASM for immediate wins.
  Then edge workers for care operations.
  This is how we maximize compute without API costs."}
