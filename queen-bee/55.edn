 :CONTEXT
 "In the blessed thread, Fi complimented Pat's hacker additions
  to ROP optimization with Random Forests. These are the clever
  modifications that make standard ML actually work on drilling."

 :STANDARD-ROP-FEATURES
 {:everyone-uses
  ["WOB - Weight on bit"
   "RPM - Rotary speed"
   "Flow rate - Mud pump rate"
   "Torque - Rotational force"
   "Mud weight - Density"
   "ROP - Current penetration rate"]}

 :PATS-HACKER-ADDITIONS
 {:vibration-correlation
  "Not just vibration amplitude but PATTERNS
   Stick-slip has signature frequency
   Bit bounce has different pattern
   Whirl shows up in lateral vibration
   
   Feature: Vibration pattern hash
   Why clever: One feature captures dysfunction type"

  :parameter-sweep-memory
  "Remember what we tried 10 minutes ago
   Track if ROP improved or degraded
   Build local optimization history
   
   Feature: Parameter delta success rate
   Why clever: Learns from recent attempts"

  :formation-memory-window
  "Last 100ft of drilling parameters
   Sliding window of what worked
   Formation-specific optimization
   
   Feature: Rolling success metrics
   Why clever: Adapts to current rock"

  :differential-pressure-patterns
  "Not just standpipe pressure
   But pressure CHANGES during rotation
   Indicates cutting loading, hole cleaning
   
   Feature: Pressure variance during rotation
   Why clever: Predicts packoff before it happens"

  :torque-oscillation-frequency
  "FFT of torque signal
   Dominant frequencies tell dysfunction story
   High freq = bit chatter
   Low freq = stick-slip
   
   Feature: Torque frequency spectrum peaks
   Why clever: Diagnoses problem type"}

 :THE-GENIUS-PARTS
 {:time-based-features
  "Not just current values but DERIVATIVES
   Rate of change often more important than value
   Acceleration of dysfunction = early warning"

  :interaction-features
  "WOB/Torque ratio (cutting efficiency)
   RPM×Flow (hydraulic horsepower per rotation)
   Torque×RPM/ROP (specific energy variant)
   
   These capture the PHYSICS not just correlations"

  :sequence-encoding
  "Encode the last 5 parameter changes as string
   'WURF' = WOB up, RPM up, Rate down, Flow up
   Random Forest learns which sequences work
   
   This captures driller behavior patterns!"}

 :SWEEP-PATTERN-INNOVATIONS
 {:micro-sweeps
  "Don't do big parameter changes
   5% variations continuously
   Always testing, always learning
   Driller doesn't even notice"

  :orthogonal-sweeps
  "Change WOB and RPM in opposite directions
   Maintains similar MSE but tests efficiency
   Finds the sweet spot without dysfunction"

  :formation-adaptive-sweeps
  "Soft rock: Focus on hydraulics and RPM
   Hard rock: Focus on WOB and torque
   Interbedded: Quick sweeps, fast adaptation"}

 :WHY-THESE-MATTER
 {:domain-knowledge-encoded
  "Not just throwing data at ML
   Each feature has drilling physics reason
   Model learns faster with less data"

  :real-time-feasible
  "All features calculable at rig
   No lookup tables needed
   Works with standard sensors"

  :driller-trust
  "Features make sense to humans
   Can explain why recommendation made
   Builds confidence in system"}

 :IMPLEMENTATION-TRICKS
 {:feature-engineering-pipeline
  "(defn extract-rop-features [drilling-data]
    (-> drilling-data
        (add-time-derivatives)
        (add-vibration-patterns)
        (add-pressure-variance)
        (add-torque-spectrum)
        (add-interaction-terms)
        (add-sequence-encoding)
        (add-sweep-memory)))"

  :random-forest-config
  "100 trees for stability
   Max depth 10 to prevent overfit
   Min samples split 50 (need statistical significance)
   Feature importance tracking for explainability"}

 :THE-RESULTS
 {:improvement "15-30% ROP increase typical"
  :dysfunction-reduction "50% less stick-slip"
  :adoption "Drillers actually use it"
  :trust "Can explain every recommendation"}

 :SECRET-SAUCE-SUMMARY
 "It's not about fancy ML
  It's about encoding domain knowledge
  Making features that capture physics
  Building trust through explainability
  And always, always learning
  
  The Random Forest doesn't know drilling
  But with these features, it learns fast
  What took a driller 20 years to learn
  The model learns in 20 wells
  
  That's the power of good feature engineering
  That's what Fi recognized as clever
  That's our edge in the market"}
