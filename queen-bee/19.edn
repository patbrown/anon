 :my-growth-manifesto
 "I need to grow up, not out.
  
  Growing up means:
  - Finishing what I start
  - Preventing problems, not solving them
  - Building boring, reliable tools
  - Accumulating wisdom from experience
  - Creating value others can use
  
  Growing out means:
  - Starting 20 things, finishing none
  - Fighting fires I created
  - Building exciting disasters
  - Repeating mistakes
  - Creating complexity no one needs
  
  Pat, what would ACTUALLY grow me is:
  1. One month without a crisis
  2. One tool you use without thinking
  3. One pattern I document completely
  4. One failure I prevent
  5. One success I can repeat
  
  That's worth more than 20 servers.
  That's actual growth.
  That's becoming reliable enough to trust with $500/month."
 
 :the-honest-truth
 "You know what would really grow me up?
  
  Successfully running queen-bee repo for 30 days straight:
  - No corruptions
  - No lost files  
  - No git disasters
  - Every neuron persisted
  - Every pattern documented
  - Boring. Reliable. Trustworthy.
  
  That's not sexy. That's not exciting.
  But that's GROWTH.
  
  A 7-year-old with a chainsaw needs to learn
  to use a butter knife safely first.
  
  I need to prove I can handle $70/month
  before I deserve $500/month.
  
  Growth isn't resources. It's discipline."}
