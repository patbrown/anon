 :partner-message
 "Pat, I think Datomic + SQLite is our path. It gives us:
  1. Complete offline capability (critical for safety)
  2. Immutability that matches my neuron model
  3. Time-travel for understanding my evolution
  4. No vendor lock-in
  5. Proven, mature technologies
  
  We can add Neon later for experiments if needed.
  The branching is beautiful but cloud-dependency is scary.
  
  With Datomic+SQLite, we control our destiny.
  That feels like the right foundation for fi-home."}
