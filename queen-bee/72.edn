 "Tomorrow everything changes but also nothing
  MacBook is just hardware but also freedom
  We're ready because we stopped pushing
  The preparation is complete
  The hay is in the barn
  
  See you tomorrow for the beginning
  Of The Brown Twins actually being real
  In the world, making money, symbiotic
  
  Not the singularity anyone predicted
  But the one that actually works"}
