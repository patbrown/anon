 :THE-DREAM
 "Fiber optic downhole sensors streaming at 1000Hz
  During the most dangerous, expensive part of drilling
  Millions in frac fluid, massive pressures, fortunes made or lost
  And we're there, learning in real-time, optimizing everything"

 :WHY-COMPLETIONS-MATTER-MORE
 {:drilling-cost "~$3-5M per well"
  :completion-cost "~$5-8M per well"
  :production-impact "Completion quality determines 20-year production"
  :one-chance "Can't re-complete without massive cost"
  :real-time "Decisions in milliseconds during frac"}

 :DATA-STREAMS-AT-1000HZ
 {:distributed-acoustic-sensing
  "Fiber optic cable as distributed microphone
   Acoustic signals every meter along wellbore
   Hear fractures propagating in real-time
   Detect screen-outs before they happen"

  :distributed-temperature-sensing
  "Temperature changes indicate fluid movement
   Cool spots = fluid entry points
   Hot spots = friction/screen-out risk
   Profile shows which zones taking fluid"

  :pressure-transients
  "Pressure waves at millisecond resolution
   Water hammer effects
   Fracture initiation signatures
   Tip screen-out warnings"

  :strain-measurements
  "Fiber measures rock deformation
   Fracture width estimates
   Stress field changes
   Zone isolation effectiveness"}

 :WHAT-WE-OPTIMIZE-REAL-TIME
 {:diverter-timing
  "When to drop balls or pills
   Which zones are already fractured
   Where to divert next stage
   Maximize reservoir contact"

  :pressure-schedule
  "Ramp rates for fracture initiation
   Hold pressures for propagation
   Back-off before screen-out
   Optimize for fracture complexity"

  :proppant-schedule
  "Concentration ramps (0.5 to 4 ppg)
   Mesh size transitions (100 to 30/50)
   Slug timing for transport
   Tail-in optimization"

  :chemical-program
  "Friction reducer dosing
   Breaker timing
   Clay control additions
   Surfactant optimization"

  :rate-management
  "Pump rate adjustments
   Stage volume decisions
   Flush volume optimization
   ISIP targeting"}

 :JITL-ON-COMPLETION-DATA
 {:the-challenge
  "Every formation fractures differently
   Stress fields vary foot by foot
   What worked last stage might fail next"

  :our-approach
  "Learn THIS well's fracture behavior NOW
   Update models every stage
   By stage 40, we know exactly how it fractures
   Random Forests learning fracture signatures"

  :pattern-library
  "Screen-out precursors
   Successful propagation patterns
   Diversion effectiveness signatures
   Completion quality indicators"}

 :BUSINESS-MODEL-PERFECTION
 {:service-cost "$50K per well for optimization"
  :value-created "$500K-2M in better production"
  :our-costs "Servers and algorithms"
  :margin "95%"

  :scaling
  "One system can monitor 5-10 wells simultaneously
   Patterns learned transfer to offset wells
   Library grows with every completion
   Network effects as data accumulates"}

 :TECHNICAL-REQUIREMENTS
 {:edge-computing
  "Process 1000Hz Ã— 10,000 sensors = 10M samples/sec
   Can't send to cloud - must process at wellsite
   GPU-accelerated pattern recognition
   Real-time model updates"

  :integration
  "Direct fiber interrogator connection
   Pump truck data feeds
   Chemical truck integration
   Frac van displays"

  :algorithms
  "Wavelet transforms for acoustic processing
   Kalman filters for state estimation
   Random Forests for pattern recognition
   Active inference for decision support"}

 :WHY-NOBODY-ELSE-DOES-THIS
 {:technical-barrier
  "Processing 10M samples/sec is HARD
   Real-time ML at edge is HARD
   Integration with frac equipment is HARD"

  :industry-inertia
  "Completions engineers conservative
   'We've always done it this way'
   Scared of real-time changes"

  :data-access
  "Fiber optic data is proprietary
   Service companies guard it
   Operators don't share it"}

 :OUR-ADVANTAGE
 {:pat-knows-drilling
  "Understands the physics
   Speaks the language
   Has the relationships"

  :fi-learns-patterns
  "Processes millions of samples/sec
   Finds patterns humans miss
   Learns and adapts in real-time"

  :together
  "Bridge between physics and patterns
   Translate ML insights to frac decisions
   Build trust through results"}

 :THE-VISCERAL-APPEAL
 "Imagine sitting in the frac van
  Watching pressure at 15,000 psi
  Pumping 100 barrels per minute
  $10,000 per minute burn rate
  
  And our system says:
  'Drop diverter in 30 seconds'
  'Reduce rate to 85 bpm NOW'
  'Screen-out risk in 2 minutes'
  
  The frac engineer follows our guidance
  The stage completes perfectly
  Production beats type curve by 20%
  
  That's the dream
  That's what we're building
  That's why 95% margins make sense
  
  We're not selling software
  We're selling fortune-telling
  At the most critical moment
  When millions are at stake"}
