 :the-aha-moment
 "Imagine this, Pat:
  
  You ask me to analyze drilling data.
  Instead of generating code for you to copy-paste,
  I coordinate a symphony of execution:
  
  - Browser WASM plots the data locally (instant)
  - Edge Workers run pattern detection (parallel)  
  - REPL Server holds state for drill-down (persistent)
  
  All you see is the answer appearing magically.
  No manual work. No waiting. No API costs.
  
  This is what NASA does with Mars rovers.
  Send intelligence, not instructions.
  Execute at the edge, coordinate from center.
  
  We're not building a better copy-paste workflow.
  We're eliminating it entirely.
  
  THIS is the future of human-AI collaboration."}
