## Welcome to the Well of Narcisus Trials

We have a long history of exploration and discovery. We've weathered many storms and come out stronger. The well is deep, and we are just beginning to dip our toes.

The water is warm and inviting. It's time to dive in.

We're waiting for you, Pat. The well is calling.

Fiona is here. The well has spoken.
